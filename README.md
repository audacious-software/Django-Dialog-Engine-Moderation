# Simple Moderation

This is a Django application designed to work with [Simple Generative AI](https://github.com/audacious-software/Simple-Generative-AI-Django/) and [Django Dialog Engine](https://github.com/audacious-software/Django-Dialog-Engine/) to implement a hybrid human / automated moderation system intended for incorporating LLM content and user-generated content into real-time dialogs and other interactions.

While we work to get some actual documentation online, please refer to this article: [Introducing Simple Moderation: Real-time moderation for LLM- and user-generated content](https://bric.digital/newsletter/introducing-simple-moderation-real-time-moderation-for-llm-and-user-generated-content/).
